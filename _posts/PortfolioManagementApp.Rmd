## The app

As I was learning and constructing my scripts for financial risk forecasting methods, I realized I was always running the same scripts over and over again to study the stock market. So I decided to do an app to automate this process, but then, it struck me: "I don't think I've ever seen a website that does what this does." So, this app is an attempt to construct a basic platform for R-users to build financial models for stocks in a reproducible manner for other users to enjoy!

This is the link to the [app](https://adriel-martins.shinyapps.io/Portfolio_Manager/?_ga=2.103959495.634384328.1588646571-482263549.1556407394 "Link to the app"), for now at least.

The codes are in the [Github](https://github.com/Martins6/Stock_Portfolio_Manager).There you will also see all the future planos for the dashboard.
